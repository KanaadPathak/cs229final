% *** MISC UTILITY PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{ifpdf}
% Heiko Oberdiek's ifpdf.sty is very useful if you need conditional
% compilation based on whether the output is pdf or dvi.
% usage:
% \ifpdf
%   % pdf code
% \else
%   % dvi code
% \fi
% The latest version of ifpdf.sty can be obtained from:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/oberdiek/
% Also, note that IEEEtran.cls V1.7 and later provides a builtin
% \ifCLASSINFOpdf conditional that works the same way.
% When switching from latex to pdflatex and vice-versa, the compiler may
% have to be run twice to clear warning/error messages.






% *** CITATION PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{cite}
% cite.sty was written by Donald Arseneau
% V1.6 and later of IEEEtran pre-defines the format of the cite.sty package
% \cite{} output to follow that of IEEE. Loading the cite package will
% result in citation numbers being automatically sorted and properly
% "compressed/ranged". e.g., [1], [9], [2], [7], [5], [6] without using
% cite.sty will become [1], [2], [5]--[7], [9] using cite.sty. cite.sty's
% \cite will automatically add leading space, if needed. Use cite.sty's
% noadjust option (cite.sty V3.8 and later) if you want to turn this off.
% cite.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. Be sure and use
% version 4.0 (2003-05-27) and later if using hyperref.sty. cite.sty does
% not currently provide for hyperlinked citations.
% The latest version can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/cite/
% The documentation is contained in the cite.sty file itself.






% *** GRAPHICS RELATED PACKAGES ***
%

\usepackage[pdftex]{graphicx} % Enhanced support for graphics
% declare the path(s) where your graphic files are
\graphicspath{{../images/}}
% and their extensions so you won't have to specify these with
% every instance of \includegraphics
\DeclareGraphicsExtensions{.pdf,.jpeg,.png}

% graphicx was written by David Carlisle and Sebastian Rahtz. It is
% required if you want graphics, photos, etc. graphicx.sty is already
% installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest version and documentation can
% be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/required/graphics/
% Another good source of documentation is "Using Imported Graphics in
% LaTeX2e" by Keith Reckdahl which can be found as epslatex.ps or
% epslatex.pdf at: http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/info/
%
% latex, and pdflatex in dvi mode, support graphics in encapsulated
% postscript (.eps) format. pdflatex in pdf mode supports graphics
% in .pdf, .jpeg, .png and .mps (metapost) formats. Users should ensure
% that all non-photo figures use a vector format (.eps, .pdf, .mps) and
% not a bitmapped formats (.jpeg, .png). IEEE frowns on bitmapped formats
% which can result in "jaggedy"/blurry rendering of lines and letters as
% well as large increases in file sizes.
%
% You can find documentation about the pdfTeX application at:
% http://www.tug.org/applications/pdftex





% *** MATH PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage[cmex10]{amsmath}
% A popular package from the American Mathematical Society that provides
% many useful and powerful commands for dealing with mathematics. If using
% it, be sure to load this package with the cmex10 option to ensure that
% only type 1 fonts will utilized at all point sizes. Without this option,
% it is possible that some math symbols, particularly those within
% footnotes, will be rendered in bitmap form which will result in a
% document that can not be IEEE Xplore compliant!
%
% Also, note that the amsmath package sets \interdisplaylinepenalty to 10000
% thus preventing page breaks from occurring within multiline equations. Use:
%\interdisplaylinepenalty=2500
% after loading amsmath to restore such page breaks as IEEEtran.cls normally
% does. amsmath.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/required/amslatex/math/

\usepackage{amsmath}   % AMS math­e­mat­i­cal fa­cil­i­ties

% *** SPECIALIZED LIST PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{algorithmic}
% algorithmic.sty was written by Peter Williams and Rogerio Brito.
% This package provides an algorithmic environment fo describing algorithms.
% You can use the algorithmic environment in-text or within a figure
% environment to provide for a floating algorithm. Do NOT use the algorithm
% floating environment provided by algorithm.sty (by the same authors) or
% algorithm2e.sty (by Christophe Fiorio) as IEEE does not use dedicated
% algorithm float types and packages that provide these will not provide
% correct IEEE style captions. The latest version and documentation of
% algorithmic.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/algorithms/
% There is also a support site at:
% http://algorithms.berlios.de/index.html
% Also of interest may be the (relatively newer and more customizable)
% algorithmicx.sty package by Szasz Janos:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/algorithmicx/

\usepackage{listings} % Typeset source code listings
% \usepackage[]{mcode}


% *** ALIGNMENT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{array} % Ex­tend­ing the ar­ray and tab­u­lar en­vi­ron­ments
% Frank Mittelbach's and David Carlisle's array.sty patches and improves
% the standard LaTeX2e array and tabular environments to provide better
% appearance and additional user controls. As the default LaTeX2e table
% generation code is lacking to the point of almost being broken with
% respect to the quality of the end results, all users are strongly
% advised to use an enhanced (at the very least that provided by array.sty)
% set of table tools. array.sty is already installed on most systems. The
% latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/required/tools/


%\usepackage{mdwmath}
%\usepackage{mdwtab}
% Also highly recommended is Mark Wooding's extremely powerful MDW tools,
% especially mdwmath.sty and mdwtab.sty which are used to format equations
% and tables, respectively. The MDWtools set is already installed on most
% LaTeX systems. The lastest version and documentation is available at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/mdwtools/


% IEEEtran contains the IEEEeqnarray family of commands that can be used to
% generate multiline equations as well as matrices, tables, etc., of high
% quality.


%\usepackage{eqparbox}
% Also of notable interest is Scott Pakin's eqparbox package for creating
% (automatically sized) equal width boxes - aka "natural width parboxes".

% *** SUBFIGURE PACKAGES ***
%\usepackage[tight,footnotesize]{subfigure}
% subfigure.sty was written by Steven Douglas Cochran. This package makes it
% easy to put subfigures in your figures. e.g., "Figure 1a and 1b". For IEEE
% work, it is a good idea to load it with the tight package option to reduce
% the amount of white space around the subfigures. subfigure.sty is already
% installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest version and documentation can
% be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/obsolete/macros/latex/contrib/subfigure/
% subfigure.sty has been superceeded by subfig.sty.



%\usepackage[caption=false]{caption}
%\usepackage[font=footnotesize]{subfig}
% subfig.sty, also written by Steven Douglas Cochran, is the modern
% replacement for subfigure.sty. However, subfig.sty requires and
% automatically loads Axel Sommerfeldt's caption.sty which will override
% IEEEtran.cls handling of captions and this will result in nonIEEE style
% figure/table captions. To prevent this problem, be sure and preload
% caption.sty with its "caption=false" package option. This is will preserve
% IEEEtran.cls handing of captions. Version 1.3 (2005/06/28) and later
% (recommended due to many improvements over 1.2) of subfig.sty supports
% the caption=false option directly:
%\usepackage[caption=false,font=footnotesize]{subfig}
%
% The latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/subfig/

% *** FLOAT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{fixltx2e}
% fixltx2e, the successor to the earlier fix2col.sty, was written by
% Frank Mittelbach and David Carlisle. This package corrects a few problems
% in the LaTeX2e kernel, the most notable of which is that in current
% LaTeX2e releases, the ordering of single and double column floats is not
% guaranteed to be preserved. Thus, an unpatched LaTeX2e can allow a
% single column figure to be placed prior to an earlier double column
% figure. The latest version and documentation can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/base/



%\usepackage{stfloats}
% stfloats.sty was written by Sigitas Tolusis. This package gives LaTeX2e
% the ability to do double column floats at the bottom of the page as well
% as the top. (e.g., "\begin{figure*}[!b]" is not normally possible in
% LaTeX2e). It also provides a command:
%\fnbelowfloat
% to enable the placement of footnotes below bottom floats (the standard
% LaTeX2e kernel puts them above bottom floats). This is an invasive package
% which rewrites many portions of the LaTeX2e float routines. It may not work
% with other packages that modify the LaTeX2e float routines. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/sttools/
% Documentation is contained in the stfloats.sty comments as well as in the
% presfull.pdf file. Do not use the stfloats baselinefloat ability as IEEE
% does not allow \baselineskip to stretch. Authors submitting work to the
% IEEE should note that IEEE rarely uses double column equations and
% that authors should try to avoid such use. Do not be tempted to use the
% cuted.sty or midfloat.sty packages (also by Sigitas Tolusis) as IEEE does
% not format its papers in such ways.


%\ifCLASSOPTIONcaptionsoff
%  \usepackage[nomarkers]{endfloat}
% \let\MYoriglatexcaption\caption
% \renewcommand{\caption}[2][\relax]{\MYoriglatexcaption[#2]{#2}}
%\fi
% endfloat.sty was written by James Darrell McCauley and Jeff Goldberg.
% This package may be useful when used in conjunction with IEEEtran.cls'
% captionsoff option. Some IEEE journals/societies require that submissions
% have lists of figures/tables at the end of the paper and that
% figures/tables without any captions are placed on a page by themselves at
% the end of the document. If needed, the draftcls IEEEtran class option or
% \CLASSINPUTbaselinestretch interface can be used to increase the line
% spacing as well. Be sure and use the nomarkers option of endfloat to
% prevent endfloat from "marking" where the figures would have been placed
% in the text. The two hack lines of code above are a slight modification of
% that suggested by in the endfloat docs (section 8.3.1) to ensure that
% the full captions always appear in the list of figures/tables - even if
% the user used the short optional argument of \caption[]{}.
% IEEE papers do not typically make use of \caption[]'s optional argument,
% so this should not be an issue. A similar trick can be used to disable
% captions of packages such as subfig.sty that lack options to turn off
% the subcaptions:
% For subfig.sty:
% \let\MYorigsubfloat\subfloat
% \renewcommand{\subfloat}[2][\relax]{\MYorigsubfloat[]{#2}}
% For subfigure.sty:
% \let\MYorigsubfigure\subfigure
% \renewcommand{\subfigure}[2][\relax]{\MYorigsubfigure[]{#2}}
% However, the above trick will not work if both optional arguments of
% the \subfloat/subfig command are used. Furthermore, there needs to be a
% description of each subfigure *somewhere* and endfloat does not add
% subfigure captions to its list of figures. Thus, the best approach is to
% avoid the use of subfigure captions (many IEEE journals avoid them anyway)
% and instead reference/explain all the subfigures within the main caption.
% The latest version of endfloat.sty and its documentation can obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/endfloat/
%
% The IEEEtran \ifCLASSOPTIONcaptionsoff conditional can also be used
% later in the document, say, to conditionally put the References on a
% page by themselves.

\usepackage{float}    % Im­proved in­ter­face for float­ing ob­jects

% *** PDF, URL AND HYPERLINK PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{url}
% url.sty was written by Donald Arseneau. It provides better support for
% handling and breaking URLs. url.sty is already installed on most LaTeX
% systems. The latest version can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/misc/
% Read the url.sty source comments for usage information. Basically,

\section{Introduction}
Automatic plant species recognition with image processing is a fine-grained image recognition problem and generally considered a hard problem due to the subtle differences between different species in the same class. Sometime such fine differences can be even challenging to humans. Typically this requires large training data but it is not feasible due to the number of planets (over 220000 \cite{Charles13}).
\begin{enumerate}
  \item The subtle differences between different species in the same class. Sometime such fine differences can be even challenging to humans.
  \item Large number of categories, over 220000 \cite{Charles13}.
\end{enumerate}

The main application are weeds identification, species discovery, plant taxonomy, natural reserve park management and so on \cite{Pedro13}.


In this report, we describe our exploration with this problem, using traditional handcrafted features and features extracted from pretrained deep convolution neural network (ConvNets).

The rest of the report is organized as follows. In section \ref{DataSet}, we describe the data set. Section.

% IEEEtran.cls defaults to using nonbold math in the Abstract.
% This preserves the distinction between vectors and scalars. However,
% if the journal you are submitting to favors bold math in the abstract,
% then you can use LaTeX's standard command \boldmath at the very start
% of the abstract to achieve this. Many IEEE journals frown on math
% in the abstract anyway.

\section{Related Work }
Research on automatic leaf classification from image has been active since 2000. Lots of hand-crafted features have since proposed, ranging from shape based, to statistical texture and margin \cite{Charles13} \cite{Pedro13} \cite{Cho2002}. Also generic computer vision object recognition/detection features, such SIFT and HOG are studied for this problem. [TODO]
Most of such manually engineered features achieve excellent accuracy on clean images taken in controlled conditions, which consist of one single well aligned leave on contrasting background, such as those images in data set [TODO ].
Recently, with the huge success of ConvNets, particularly in annual ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge \cite{Alex2014}, researchers start to apply ConvNets to this problem [TODO].  [TODO] have suggested that generic features can be extracted from large ConvNet and yield very good results on fine-grained classification problems even without fine-tuning the pretrained model.

\section{DataSet}
\label{DataSet}
    We found two types of data set
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Clean images, which consists of well aligned leaf on single contrasting background, with little or no variations of luminance or color. \\
  \begin{center}
      \begin{tabular}{| l | l | l |}
      \hline
      Name & Species & Samples Per Species        \\ \hline
      Swedish \cite{SwedishLeafDataset} & 15 & 75        \\ \hline
      Flavia \cite{FlaviaDataset}       & 33 & $\sim$ 60 \\ \hline
      UCI \cite{UCIDataSet}:            & 40 & 5~16      \\ \hline
      Kaggle \cite{Pedro13}:            & 99 & 16        \\ \hline
      \end{tabular}
  \end{center}

  \item ImageCLEF \cite{ImageCLEF2013}, which is collected through crowd sourced application, has 250 species and 26077 images. This is a much more challenging datasets with variations on lighting conditions, viewpoints, background clutters and even occlusions. The data further split to different subset: uniform, which is relatively with less clutter, and natrual-background, which is taken in a total natural enviroment. To effectively evaluate our approaches, we use subsets of this dataset.\\
  \begin{center}
      \begin{tabular}{| l | l | l | l |}
      \hline
      Name    & Species & train samples & test samples \\ \hline
      uniform & 66      & [TODO:]       & 1194         \\ \hline
      natural & 57      & 2585          & 521          \\ \hline
      \end{tabular}
  \end{center}
\end{enumerate}

\section{Approach}

\subsection{Overview}
Images captured in the field, such as those from ImageCLEF \cite{ImageCLEF2013}, are more challenging as there are much more intra class variations due to viewpoint, lighting condition and occlusion.
We break down the problem into two pieces. Firstly, we want to locate the leaf in the image which is an single object localization problem.  This step becomes necessary if the image have multiple objects and possibly leaf is not the most salient object.  Then, we predict the species of the leaf, which is a fine-grained classification problem. This is the main task and for most data set, we only need to perform this task. Here we explore both traditional method, such as Bag of Features,  and ConvNets based method.

\begin{figure}[H]
  \center
  \includegraphics[scale=0.2]{overview}
  \caption{ Overview of the system }
  \label{fig:pipeline}
\end{figure}

  Firstly, during preprocessing, we apply Contrast Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalization to reduce lighting condition variation and raw images are resized to fit to the next layer. In traditional approach, we also use K-means to remove background color heuristically. For challenging dataset, we find the convex hull containing the largest N contours and then use GrabCut to segment leaf out of the background clutter.
  Next we extract features and we explore two options,
\begin{enumerate}
  \item ConvNets.
    We take transfer learning approach, in order to make use of the power of ConvNets with the constrains of time and computations. Specifically, we take a couple of ConvNets that are pretrained with ImageNet for ILSVRC object image classification task, remove one or two top layers and then treat the rest of the ConvNet as fixed feature extractor for the our data set.


  \item SIFT + Bag of Features
    Key points are densely sampled and SIFT feature descriptors are retrieved from each raw images. Then at last, we train a classifier, using the feature vectors from the above step and predict labels for our test data.
\end{enumerate}


Part of reason

[Explain the data set for our pretrained model and why this is this is applicable to our problem, i.e. same feature space.]

[Explains architecture of ResNet50]

The CNN codes (feature vector) we get from ResNet50 is 2048 dimensions.
We have two settings.
\begin{itemize}
  \item [--] [explain preprocessing] The feature vector is normalized with unit variance and we learn a linear SVM classifier [(or others)] from the features.
  \item [--] We further augment the training set by adding rotated and shifted copies of samples.
\end{itemize}

[Explain if and how this method is suitable for our task]
-The CNN codes are trained for the object image classification task of ILSVRC (2013 for VGGNet and 2015 for ResNet), which is aligned with our task except that ours are more fine-grained classification.
-Some of our data set [ImageCLEF2013] is more challenging in term of clutter and occlusion.


\section{Object recognition}
\subsection{Bag of Features (BoF) + local feature descriptors}
   Due to the simplicity and performance, this well established approach was taken at first. Interest points are detected from the raw images and then local invariant feature descriptors are collected, which are clustered to form the visual vocabulary/codebook. Afterwards, each raw image can be represented with histograms of visual words, i.e. term vectors.  We have prototyped a BoF system, based on the OpenCV package.  Here is the illustration of the system \ref{fig:bofsystemdesign}.
\newpage
\begin{figure}
  \centering
  \includegraphics[scale=0.2]{flowchart}
  \caption{ System Design for BoF }
  \label{fig:bofsystemdesign}
\end{figure}
During preprocessing, raw images are converted to gray-scaled images and resized to reduce computation complexity. We extract SIFT descriptors from the pixels after detecting the key points. Limiting the width of image to 128 pixels, we have roughly 200 SIFT descriptors per image. Then all the descriptors are clustered to build visual words via K-Means. Due to computation complexity, we pick randomly 100 training images to build the visual vocabulary for the initial run.

\section{Object detection }
[TODO describe why we need this]
We use traditional exhaustive search method to scan through all window, scales.

\section{ConvNets approach}
  \subsection{exploration}

  We started by training CNN classifier from scratch, following the guidelines below:
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item Convolutional layer learning features from general to specific, giving more layers helps with the transition.
    \item Dropout reduces overfitting
    \item Use aggressive pooling to reduce the dimensionality.
  \end{enumerate}
  We designed our CNN with the architecture below:
  \begin{align}
    (Conv-ReLU-MaxPool)x3-FC-DropOut-SoftMax
  \end{align}
  It works well with \cite{SwedishLeafDataset}, with an error rate of [],
  But when test against \cite{ImageCLEF2013}, the accuracy reduced significantly. There are a few things to consider:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item The fore-mentioned lighting variation and background clutter.
    \item More species with less samples per classes.
  \end{itemize}
  [More noise need more variations and more aggressive filtering thus deeper network is required]

  Research shows number of samples need to be big enough to avoid excessive overfitting. See B section of the supplementary material of \cite{Jason2014}. Note that the research is proven for AlexNet. While we don't have enough data to seek for the threshold which suffices to avoid overfitting for ResNet50, we assume 20 per samples is still not enough.

  [explain why species with less sample will reduce the performance. Explain why sample per classes makes it harder to predict Learning Theory] [TODO]

  [TODO: learning curve]

  A deeper CNN with better architecture is needed for the complicity of our data.
  Thus we switched to pre-trained weight of proven CNN architecture.

  Jason et al. found that even features transferred from distant tasks are better than random. weights\cite{Jason2014}

  Starting from VGG16, [TODO: reference to VGG16]
  [TODO: why ResNet50 is better than VGG16]

  With ResNet50


  \subsection{process}


  generalization vs specialization,

  remove top layer,
  predict with upper layer

  extract features

  final output

  \subsection{Discussion}
    How do you decide what type of transfer learning you should perform on a new dataset? This is a function of several factors, but the two most important ones are the size of the new dataset (small or big), and its similarity to the original dataset (e.g. ImageNet-like in terms of the content of images and the classes, or very different, such as microscope images). Keeping in mind that ConvNet features are more generic in early layers and more original-dataset-specific in later layers, here are some common rules of thumb for navigating the 4 major scenarios:
    \cite{CS231N}

    \begin{enumerate}
      \item similarity (transfer learning is good)
      \item size for each class(fine tuning is not a good idea)
    \end{enumerate}



\section{Experimental Results}
[Explain cross validation approach we used]

We use prediction rank-1 identification (i.e. accuracy) as our performance metric, which is defined as $Accurary = \frac{N_c}{N_t} \times 100 \%$, where $N_c$ represents the number of correct match and $N_t$ is the total number of test samples.
