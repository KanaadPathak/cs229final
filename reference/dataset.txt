3. Swedish leaf dataset
http://www.cvl.isy.liu.se/en/research/datasets/swedish-leaf/
The files are named so that it is easy to find the leaf/leaves that we want. A file could be named for example : 
l9nr003.tif

l	is short for leaf
9	is treeclass nine
nr	is short for number
003	is the number of the leaf of the specific treeclass
